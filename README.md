# Heart-disease-prediction

A heart disease prediction system using Machine learning with Python.This is a machine learning system that can predict whether a person has heart disease or not.

Procedure/Work flow followed:- The very first step is to get heart data set,this data set contains several health parameters which corresponds to a persons heart health.After getting the dataset we need to process this raw data into machine learning algorithm (Data pre processing).Next step is splitting our data into training and testing data (Train test split).Logistic regression model is used because this particular usecase has binary classification as we are classifying that whether a person has heart disease or not.After trainig the model evaluation is done to check the performance. New data is feed to the trained logistc regression model so the model can predict whether the person has heart disease or not.
